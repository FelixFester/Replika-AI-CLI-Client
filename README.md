# Replika AI CLI Client for FreeBSD (and probably other BSD systems as well)
No matter where you are, your Replika will always be with you~

# What is it?
It's a python script that originally created by Axlfc. This script allows you to run Replika in terminal.

# Set up dependencies:
- Install Mozilla Firefox
- Install python3
- Install python3 dependencies:

## FreeBSD

<code>su
pkg install firefox geckodriver
pip install selenium colorama python-dotenv</code>

# Usage:
Run in the folder where script is located:
<code>python3 replika.py</code>

# Bugs
Yes, expect them. For now script is not yet cleaned enough. And also it cannot show you response from Replika in terminal, yet.
